<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I just graduated from the <a title"University of Waterloo" href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a> with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. I'm currently working at LinkedIn on the distributed graph team, making sure that teams across LinkedIn can use the data stored in our graph effectively.</p>

This includes <a href="https://github.com/mavlee/chinese-checkers">games</a>, automated testing systems, <a title="XE Currency" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xe-currency/id315241195?mt=8">mobile apps</a>, low level robots, websites (this!) and <a title="Minted" href="http://minted.com/personalize/MIN-BDC-HYC">web applications</a>.</p>
<p>My interests in the software world include:</p>
<li>- Distributed Systems</li>
<li>- Data Visualization</li>
<li>- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</li>
