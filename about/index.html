<h1>Codes</h1>
<p>I've worked with a whole range of languages and systems, and through internships, school and personal work I've worked on a variety of different projects.  This includes <a href="https://github.com/mavlee/chinese-checkers">games</a>, automated testing systems, <a title="XE Currency" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xe-currency/id315241195?mt=8">mobile apps</a>, low level robots, websites (this!) and <a title="Minted" href="http://minted.com/personalize/MIN-BDC-HYC">web applications</a>.</p>
<h1>School</h1>
<p>I'm in my 3B term for Mechatronics Engineering at the <a title="University of Waterloo" href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. Mechatronics is a cool sounding but not too clever portmanteau of mechanical and electrical.  It basically means I study things that allows me to work with robotics.  I try to learn robotics and physics at school and programming on my own and on the job.</p>
<h1>Random</h1>
<p>I'm not quite sure I should put here.  I enjoy taking in the local food scene.  I can't juggle.  Or do backflips.  I like to play all them racquet sports (but especially tennis and pingpong).  I make terrible jokes.</p>
