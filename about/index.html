<h1>Codes</h1>
<p>Thanks to the Waterloo co-op program, I've had the pleasure to work on things ranging from automated testing systems to <a title="XE Currency" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xe-currency/id315241195?mt=8">mobile apps</a> to <a title="Minted" href="http://minted.com">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>School</h1>
<p>I'm in my 3A term for Mechatronics Engineering at the <a title="University of Waterloo" href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. Basically Mechatronics sounds awesome and I enjoy robotics, but software is my passion.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of a robot I helped make for HuRot club</p>
<h1>Random</h1>
<p>I'm not quite sure I should put here.  I'm a minor foodie (trying to become a bigger one) and I can't juggle.  Or do backflips.  I like to play all them racquet sports.</p>
