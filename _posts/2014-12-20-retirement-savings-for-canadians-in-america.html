<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not a tax person. Some of this may be wrong. This is a summary of what I've found and researched, but if you see anything wrong, please leave a comment and I will update it.</em></p>

<p>Various people have been asking me recently about this sort of stuff and what they should do, so I decided to write something that will hopefully clarify what options are available to Canadians.</p>

<h3>A little background...</h3>
<p>Canadians working in America have additional considerations when deciding how to save money for retirement or otherwise. Typically, a RRSP would be set up and used for deferred tax gains and a TFSA can also be set up. However in America, different retirement accounts are available. 401k is the equivalent to the RRSP, though as far as I understand it, this is not available from every employer. This gives tax deferred gains, meaning the contribution is reduced from your income tax, but income tax will be taken at the time of withdrawal. The maximum contribution for 2015 is $18000. TFSA does not have a true equivalent in America, but Roth IRA comes close. You can put $5500 post tax into a Roth IRA and enjoy tax free gains on it, even when you withdraw (assuming you do it after you are 59.5). The original contribution can always be withdrawn, similar to the TFSA. However, if your income is over $114k, the access to this account starts to phase out, stoping completely at $129k. If your income is over $129k, you can contribute to a regular IRA, which has similar rules to a 401k.</p>

<p>Of course, any of this only matters if you anticipate leaving America. Otherwise, for all intents and purpose, you are an American and regular saving strategies apply. Otherwise, depending on how soon you want your money and where you plan on eventually living, you will want to allocate your money differently.</p>

<h3>Options for Retirement Accounts After Leaving America</h3>

<h4>1. Withdraw everything</h4>
<p>This option is pretty self explanatory. You can withdraw all your money from 401k accounts and IRAs and then do whatever you want with it afterwards. You will be charged a 15% withholding tax on the withdrawal as well as a 10% early withdrawal fee if you are less that 59.5. If you are moving back to Canada, you need to report this, but this withdrawal will get you a foreign tax credit.</p>

<h4>2. Leave it all in America</h4>
<p>This options allows for continued tax deferred gains. I'm unclear as to whether or not American taxes need to filed every year, but I would assume not, since everything is in retirement accounts. After turning 59.5 the money can be withdrawn, in which case you pay regular American income tax, and then Canadian tax on it (assuming Canadian residence).</p>

<h4>3. Transfer it a RRSP</h4>
<p>With some paperwork, 401k / IRA can be transferred to a Canadian RRSP. This wouldn't count towards the RRSP contribution limit. The transfer would still be hit with the 15% withholding tax and potentially 10% penalty tax, but a foreign tax credit would be received for that amount. There is no equivalent transfer from RRSP to IRA, meaning there is no tax credit you will receive transferring from Canada to America.</p>

<h3>Additional note on Roth IRA</h3>
<p>Anything that isn't taxed on the Roth IRA in America will not be taxed in Canada, so it can still be treated as a TFSA. Unfortunately, there is no way to actually transfer a Roth IRA to a TFSA or vice versa (without tax implications) so you would be stuck managing two accounts.

<h3>So what should you do?</h3>

<p>So knowing all of this, and assuming you are optimizing for money (and minimal hassle), how should you allocate money to retirement accounts? The optimal decision depends on your exact situation, but I will outline what I consider to be the valid strategies.</p>

<h4>Contribute the minimum and withdraw after leaving</h4>
<p>If you intend to leave in a few years, you can contribute only to the 401k up to whateer the employer matches (in many cases 0) and then withdraw everything after leaving America. Any employer matching should make up for the loss from the withholding and penalty tax. This has the advantage of keeping all of your finances together and being able to use it however you want. However, in addition to whatever taxes you would pay on the withdrawal, you would also be paying higher income tax during the years you are working in the US.</p>

<h4>Contribute the maximum and leave it in America</h4>
<p>If you don't mind the inconveience of keeping a separate American account, this strategy should give you the most savings. You would pay the least amount of income tax in the present, and you wouldn't incur any taxes withdrawing or doing any transfers. This is a good option if you want the most savings and don't mind the hassle, or if you intend to return to America again in the future. The downside of this plan is that if you plan on making large purchases in Canada (like a house or car), you won't have access to this money. There is also the risk of USD tanking relative to CAD. </p>

<h4>Contribute the maximum and transfer over to RRSP</h4>
<p>This is similar to contributing and leaving in the America, but your accounts will be consolidated and allows you to do things like use the money to purchase property in Canada. You also wouldn't have to file US taxes anymore. However, since you are getting back tax credits on the withdrawal, your actual retirement holdings are less, as you've paid some taxes on what were tax deferred accounts. This should also only be done if you never intend to return to America.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Unless you need all of your money outside of retirement accounts, I would recommend contributing as much as possible into the retirement accounts. For someone unsure about the future like myself, this allows me to save while still giving me options on dealing with my money in the future.</p>
