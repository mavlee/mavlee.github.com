title: Web Design is Hard

<p>I hate my new design.  Perhaps hate is a bit of a strong word, but I'm going to stick with it for now.  For anyone who has been to my site before, you'll notice not much has changed.  The page is a little wider, the blues are slightly different, the right navigation bar is now a left navigation bar, etc etc.  All in all, a pretty small list of changes, but it took me 4 (procrastination filled) days.  Four stupid days!</p>
<p>There was once upon a time where I considered myself to be a bit artistic and creative, I would spend days drawing and painting and playing around with Photoshop and video editors.  When I first started up this site, I figured I would get up something workable, and then go back and fix it later.  After all, how hard can making a personal website be?  As I now know, it's stupidly hard.  I would like to think that I can tell good design from a bad design, but having the ability to judge is completely different from the ability to create.</p>
<p>To be honest, these past four days I have had no idea what I was doing.  Fuelled by my hatred of blue color schemes, I looked at everything from <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com">here</a>.  This site is a trap for all of you non-designer people.  I went in thinking "Oh man, all of these color schemes look so good!" so I ended up trying all of them on the site.  They all looked terrible.  Maybe I'm not doing something right, but bright colors are useless in my hands.</p>
<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<p><strong>Colors</strong><br>
I would like to say that I chose these new colors for a specific reason, but I would be lying.  I still don't like blue color schemes.
</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar</strong><br>
It's pretty much the same, but on the left now.  It's also fixed on the page now.  I couldn't manage to get it fixed and on the right at the same time, but this part I think works ok.
</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br>
Home and Blog are now the same page (my home page was useless)<br>
The page is a little wider (800px was too small I think)<br>
The background is now an image (because solid colors are boring)
</p>
<p>I guess what I'm really trying to say is... <strong>designers are useful</strong>.  Help me fix my site.</p>
