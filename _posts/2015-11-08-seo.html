<p>Years ago, when I started this blog, I just assumed that eventually this site would end up as the top search result. From what I understand about the basics of SEO, having the domain counts for a lot. The site is also relevant to me, and I have links from various social media accounts back to this site. After about a year, I toppled the formidable "Lee Ainsle Maverick Capital" results. Further below would be my social media accounts, and then LinkedIn and Facebook generic profile searches.</p>

<p>However, looking today, I see I've dropped down to the 6th result, under LinkedIn and Facebook, and images for whatever reason. Even worse is that my result is below the fold now (at least on my display). On the plus side, two of the results above are my profiles.</p>

<p>Either way, I'm planning on being back on top.</p>
