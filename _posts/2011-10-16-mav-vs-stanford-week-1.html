title: Mav vs Stanford - Week 1
category: online courses
---

<p>A little while back, looking at reddit and hacker news, I noticed that Stanford was offering 3 courses: <a href="db-class.com">Introduction to Databases</a>, <a href="ml-class.com">Machine Learning</a> and <a href="ai-class.com">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a>.  Of course, all three courses were of interest of me, especially since I have no opportunity to take these courses as a Mechatronics student...  Hopefully this will provide insight into how a student approaches these courses, as one who has some programming knowledge, but no formal training.
<p>Stanford is offering 3 courses online: Introduction to Databases, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning.  I plan on completing all the advanced tasks every week, and posting my thoughts / reflections every Sunday.  This is week 1, Sunday October 16, 2011</p>
<h2>Introduction to Databases</h2>
<li>?? units, 0 quizzes, 0 assignments</li>
<p>Naturally, no work was done on this course.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<li>3 units, 3 quizzes, 0 assignments</li>
<p>There is a lot more content to get through than expected, with about 3 hours worth of online lectures to get through to cover all the quiz material.  Thankfully, the videos have a 1.5x speed function.</p>
<h3>Quiz 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The material was pretty interesting, and suitable for an introduction.  Unfortunately, I watched these videos right when the course opened, and did the quizzes much later.
<br><br>
<strong>3 Attempts:</strong> 4/5, 3.75/5, 5/5</p>
<h3>Quiz 2: Linear Regression with one variable</h3>
<p>I tried this quiz without watching the videos and it didn't go so well.  On my second attempt, I was just starting through the videos and I got impatient.  Third attempt, got through most of the material.  Fourth attempt, same thing.  There seems to be some sort of correlation between how much of the content I go through, and my results.
<br><br>
<strong>4 Attempts:</strong> 2.25/5, 4.25/5, 4.5/5, 5/5</p>
<h3>Quiz 3: Linear Algebra</h3>
<p>To be honest, I was quite pressed for time, and I have taken a bit of linear algebra before, so I skipped these videos hoping the quiz would be easy.  It was.
<br><br>
<strong>1 Attempt:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<li>2 units, ?? video questions, 1 homework assignment</li>
<p>Machine Learning and AI kind of go hand in hand, but apparently not their sites.  AI uses youtube for their videos, which means I have no easy way to speed up the videos.</p>
<h3>Unit 1: Welcome to AI</h3>
<p>Seems like pretty basic background knowledge, but a lot of content.  A bunch of videos with questions at the end, all easy. Note: I was running out of time, stopped halfway through.</p>
<h3>Unit 2: Problem Solving</h3>
<p>I skipped watching the videos for this unit, will return to later.</p>
<h3>Homework 1</h3>
<p>I was attempting this with little to no background knowledge.  I was caught off guard when I learned the grade wasn't displayed, so I guess I will see how well I did afterwards.  The first few questions were kind of repetitive, and I wish they were laid out in a better format.</p>
<li>?? / ?? (will update)</li>
<h2>What I've Learned</h2>
<li>Start earlier</li>
<li>These courses require effort</li>
<p>The usual strategy of not paying attention in e-class will probably not work.  I shouldn't be surprised, considering this is from Stanford, and is designed to be web versions of actual courses.  I also seem to be working full time, so perhaps a suitable strategy is to tackle one course every two days.</p>
