<p>There is only one correct way to have beef (medium rare).  Sadly, that's not how my roast beef turned out.</p>

<p>First let me say that I've never tried making roast beef before, and in general, I have been avoiding the oven.  This is mainly because I don't know how to bake, and I don't want to ruin large cuts of meat.  My dad happened to drop by one day and give me this massive piece of meat, and luckily, told me how to prepare it.  The best part of this meal is that I did almost none of the work, and it still ended up tasting ok.
<h3>Step 1: Get your dad to bring the roast</h3>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I didn't buy the roast, <strike>partly</strike> mostly because I'm too cheap, and partly because I don't know how to pick meat.  Apparently, the next step is to season the meat with salt and pepper, or whatever you prefer, but luckily that was done for me too.
<h3>Step 2: Go to class and have your suitemate put in the oven</h3>
<p>Everyone was on a tight schedule that day, and I had been informed that roasting takes 2 hours.  My suitemate (let's call him Jack) put it in the oven after preheating to 375F.  He also made the rice.<p>
<h3>Step 3: Take it out of the oven</h3>
<p>This part is actually much harder than you think, since I had to take it out with two little cloths.  People also say to rest the meat.  I'm not exactly sure what this does, but it was rested for 15 minutes.  The next step is cutting the meat and serving.  The cutting is also really hard with one of those typical small forks.</p>

<p>That's what we had in the end, rice, roast beef and broccoli.  The only part I actually did was the broccoli.  Vegetables are totally optional for this meal.</p>
