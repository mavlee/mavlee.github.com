title: Thoughts on Backpacking and Travelling Around Europe
category: europe, food, miscellaneous
---

<p>Recently, I came back from a 3 week backpacking trip around Europe. The differences in Canadian culture compared to various parts of Europe can be subtle, but here are the things I noticed along the way, as well as a few potentially useful tips.</p>

<h3>Advice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>- bring a towel, not every hostel has them, and can be used as makeshift pillow or other things</li>
  <li>- check if the hostel accepts payment by card, and adjust accordingly</li>
  <li>- check the weather -- I assumed it didn't rain on vacations, but apparently it does</li>
  <li>- bring a nice water bottle, or buy a big one when you get there</li>
  <li>- don't go into restaurants where someone comes out to greet you and tells you to go in</li>
</ul>

<h3>Random Observations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>- Venice is much nicer than I thought it would be (my expectations were low)</li>
  <li>- Japanese signage was more prominent than Chinese signage</li>
  <li>- I don't understand rules about tap water in restaurants, some would serve it to us, while other's refused</li>
  <li>- house wine gets cheaper the further south you go</li>
  <li>- McDonalds is slightly different in every country, I still regret not having the McBaguette</li>
  <li>- Italy didn't have free wifi at major stations (at least when I checked)</li>
  <li>- Indonesian food is a big thing in Amsterdamn</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll be adding to the list as I remember them.</p>
