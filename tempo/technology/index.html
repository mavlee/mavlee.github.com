<h1>The Technology</h1>
<h2>Sensor</h2>

<p>Using the Microsoft Kinect, the player's position and skeleton will be tracked. The sensor will track individual joints on the player in 3D.  By processing these inputs, we can decide if the player is doing the appropriate action, with regards to any parts of their body, such as avoiding walls or hitting objects.  The Kinect sensor comes as a pre-assembled package of sensors, minimizing the time we need to spend in this area of development.  The Kinect also comes with a publicly available Software Development Kit that allows us to quickly leverage all of the capabilities of the Kinect.</p>

<h2>Music Analysis</h2>
<p>A music file supplied is analysed to detect occurences of beats, or accented notes, which will then be used to dynamically create new levels, resulting in limitless game playing possibilities.</p>

<p>The supplied music is first read as FFT data. The spectral flux, which is the sum of the absolute value of the change in magnitude across all frequencies between samples, is calculated. A threshold value for each spectral flux is calculated by calculating a moving average. This threshold is applied to the spectral flux data, and the peaks of the resulting data are picked out. As seen in the above graph, the beats of a song can be picked out.</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>The graphics for the game is powered by OpenGL API and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. OpenGL is a very powerful API to use for graphics which is also widely supported. The game was built to have lightweight graphics which are compatible and able run on most computers with ease.</p>

<p>The models and the world were constructed as a concept art with paper and pen and slowly built up from there. The levels were constructed with the ideaology that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. Tempo was a great pleasure to build and test, and hope that the experience is just as good playing it.</p>
