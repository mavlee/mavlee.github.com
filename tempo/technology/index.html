<h2>The Technology</h2>
<h3>Sensor</h3>
<p>Using the Microsoft Kinect, the user's position and skeleton will be tracked.  By processing these inputs, we can decide if the player is doing the appropriate action, such as avoiding walls or hitting objects.</p>
<h3>Music Analysis</h3>
<p>The song the player selects to play will be analyzed, finding the positions of the beats, the tempo of the music, as well as the genre of the music and the type of intruments being played.  These will then be used to dynamically create new levels, resulting in limitless game playing possibilities.</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>Using OpenGL, a 3D world will be brought to life, and the user's actions will be translated onto the screen.</p>
