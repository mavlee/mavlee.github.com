<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>People love to interact with their music, whether it is through singing, dancing, or more recently, through playing games.</p>

<p>However, music games such as Rock Band and Dance Dance Revolution have only a limited number of songs you can play with. Their solution to this is to sell mini packs of songs or to just release new versions of their game.</p>

<p>Even if games are eventually updating with the music you want to interact with, it takes extra time and money to do this. There's no way to play with any music you have right away.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Introducting Tempo, a fun interactive game where you can choose what music you play with.</p>

<p>Tempo is a music game that will take any music you give it and generate a new level for you to play in. In this way, the game has unlmited replayability, because every song will be a different experience.</p>

<p>Users play using the Microsoft Kinect, physically moving to avoid objects and to perform other actions. The actions will be synchronized to the music, so you may even feel like you're dancing!</p>
