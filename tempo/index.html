<h2>Better Music Interactive Game</h2>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Currently there are many music games, but the majority only have preset music lists.  Playing games with new music implies waiting for a new version of the game to be released and then hoping your favourite song is included in the list.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Our solution is to provide a fun interactive game where you can choose what music you play with.</p>
