<h1>The Team</h1>

<p>Hanjun Kim is the greatest member of the team. He is the finest developer, with an intense passion for Tempo. He has spent day and night polishing up the product. He will amaze you all with the product once it is finished. Any flaws in the product are due to Maverick's incompetency.</p>

<p>Maverick Lee is the awesomest member of the team. He even made this website. Currently he spends all of his time on Tempo, making sure it is perfect. In his spare time he enjoys making fun of hipsters and playing video games.</p>

<h2><a href="http://jerrysun.me">Jerry Sun</a></h2>

<p>Jerry Sun is the biggest Microsoft fanboy on the team, which is why we're using a Kinect. In his spare time he buys new phones and sells his slightly older phones.</p>
